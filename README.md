# BNDJail
A custom Jailbreak plugin for Boundary Servers

## What is this?
BNDJail is a custom made Jailbreak plugin for Boundary Servers. It features many of the features available in most Jail gamemodes with extra features trimmed out. It is also incredibly flexible with a key focus on modules rather than being one monolithic plugin.

## When will this be done?
BNDJail won't be done for some time now. After the base is done, several modules will be built off it.

## Why though?
Starting up a new Jailbreak server has always been a bit of a painful experience with tiny little issues cropping up, a myriad of configuration files, and extra features that I just never needed. To fix all of these issues would be a huge undertaking and it just makes sense to start fresh with a custom version rather than strip out features and make fixes for the existing ones on the market.
