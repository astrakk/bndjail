# BNDJail
A custom Jailbreak plugin for Boundary Servers

## What is this?
BNDJail is a custom made Jailbreak plugin for Boundary Servers. It features many of the features available in most Jail gamemodes with extra features trimmed out. It is also incredibly flexible with a key focus on modules rather than being one monolithic plugin.

## When will this be done?
BNDJail won't be done for some time now. After the base is done, several modules will be built off it.

## Why though?
Starting up a new Jailbreak server has always been a bit of a painful experience with tiny little issues cropping up, a myriad of configuration files, and extra features that I just never needed. To fix all of these issues would be a huge undertaking and it just makes sense to start fresh with a custom version rather than strip out features and make fixes for the existing ones on the market.

## How does it work?
At the core of BNDJail is the main plugin file (bndjail.smx). This plugin provides all of the main role functionality (wardens, rebels, freedays) as well as other simple features like team balancing. Additional features such as last requests are added as modules to the main plugin, allowing server managers to swap out with their own versions of each module should they want to. This complete and total separation of features into modules also makes it far easier to tweak minor things in BNDJail.
